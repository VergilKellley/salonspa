           <h2><span style="color:var(--accent-color)">angel</span>hair</h2>
           <p>Citing the casual glamour that defines Chicago as a strong motivating factor behind his move here from London 30 years ago, Melvin—who started his career in an environment of incomparable exclusivity, the Queen’s hair salon—strove to channel Chicagos’s quintessential relaxed vibe in the launch of angelhair, which Melissa agrees is not your typical mid-western establishment. “The environment we’ve created at angelhair is a comfortable, carefree one,” she said. “We want the experience to be fun for everyone.” Speaking of the environment inside, not a detail was overlooked in making it one of refined visual beauty. Impeccably chosen finishes—rich walnut and luxe marble, for instance—establish an esthetic that juxtaposes the city’s requisite opulence with the comfort and whimsicality of which Melissa speaks.</p>
